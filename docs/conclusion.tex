\section{Conclusion}
We have presented a novel algorithm for setting the liquidity parameter in LMSR that achieves several desirable outcomes. In addition, we contributed to the literature about LMSR's ability to aggregate information by showing properties of the minimum cost path given an equilibrium solution concept. 

\subsection{Future Directions}
Future research could attempt to extend our Online Learner so that it earns positive profit since the bounded loss condition is a barrier to the practical adoption of LMSR. Additional research could extend our work to situations where agents' beliefs are not drawn from a singular distribution.
