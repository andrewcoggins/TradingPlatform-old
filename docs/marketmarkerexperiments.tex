\section{Motivation}

So... LMSR... while great in theory (why?? path independence), sucks in practice (why??).
We want to 

\section{Goals}
To test five different market maker mechanisms for their liquidity sensitivity,
profit expectation and accuracy.  


\section{Definitions}

In this document we care only about prediction markets. 
We denote time by $\Time\in\mathbb{R}_+$ ...
An \mydef{event} has an outcome where we restrict
our attention to a binary outcome: YES in case the event occurs 
and NO otherwise. We assume there is a way to unambiguously determine the outcome of an event. 
An \mydef{option} is a security that yields a return depending on the outcome
of an event, has a price 
$\OptionPrice(\Option,\Time)$ at time $\Time$ ....
An \mydef{agent} $\Agent\in\Agents$ has 
a belief $\AgentBelief_{\Agent\Time} \in [0,1]$ at time $\Time$ 
is a measure of the degree ...
A \mydef{prediction market} trades outcomes in an event. Formally,
a prediction market is a tuple $\left<\Option_0,\Option_1, \Agents, \Book\right>$...
A prediction market has a \mydef{book}... 
A book at time $\Time$ records all the transactions made up to time $\Time$
A transaction 
A \mydef{market maker} is ...

In this experiments we will test the following five market markers.
\subsection{Market Maker 1}
\subsection{Market Maker 2}
\subsection{Market Maker 3}
\subsection{Market Maker 4}
