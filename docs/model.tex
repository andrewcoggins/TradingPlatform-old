\section{Model}

\subsection{Definitions}

We denote \mydef{time} by $\Time\in\mathbb{R}_+$. \\

An \mydef{event} $\Event$ has an outcome at time $\Event_\EventTime \in \mathbb{R}_+$. 
Observe that we restrict our attention to binary outcomes. 
The outcome is equal to YES in case the event occurs, and NO otherwise. 
We denote the YES outcome with a 1, and the NO outcome with a 0.
We assume there is a way to unambiguously determine the outcome of an event. \\

$\Revealer$ is an \mydef{oracle} for mapping an event to an outcome.
We denote the outcome of event $\Event$ under $\Revealer$ as 
$\Revealer(\Event) \in \{0,1\}$.\\

An \mydef{option} $\Option(\Event) = \left<\Option_\Event, \Option_\OptionDirection\right>$ is a security that yields a return depending on 
the outcome of an event $\Option_\Event$. Each option has a direction 
$\Option_\OptionDirection \in \{0, 1\}$. 
The option will convert to \$1 at time $\Event_\EventTime$ if $\Revealer(\Option_\Event)$ equals 
$\Option_\OptionDirection$, otherwise it converts to \$0. Two options are said to be
\mydef{complementary options} if they trade opposite directions in the same event. Given an
event $\Event$, we denote the complementary options as 
$\Option_\Event = \left<\Option_{0}, \Option_{1}\right>$.\\

%Given complementary options $\Option_{0}$ and $\Option_{1}$,
%let $\Agents_{\Option_0}$ be the \mydef{set of agents} that acquire option
%$\Option_{0}$, and similarly let $\Agents_{\Option_1}$ be the set 
%of agents that acquire option $\Option_{1}$. 
%Let $\Agents_\Option = \Agents_{\Option_0} \cup \Agents_{\Option_1}$
%be the set of all agents trading complementary options.\\

An \mydef{agent} $\Agent\in\Agents$ has a \mydef{private belief} 
$\Agent_\AgentBelief \in {0,1}$ 
and a \mydef{budget} $\Agent_\AgentBudget \in \mathbb{R}_+$.
The agent's private belief $\Agent_\AgentBelief$ 
is the subjective probability that the agent
assigns to the outcome of event $\Option_\Event$ being direction $\Option_\OptionDirection$
at strike time $\Event_\EventTime$. \\

An agent's $\Agent\in\Agents$ \mydef{strategy} 
$\AgentStrategy_\Agent(\Time) \in \mathbb{R}_+$ specifies the quantity of option 
$\Option$ purchased by the agent at time $\Agent_\Time$. $\Agent_\Time \leq \EventTime. \Option_\EventTime$\\

A \mydef{prediction market} $\Market$ is a forum for trading complementary options. 
Formally, a prediction market is a tuple $\Market(\Option_\Event) = 
\left<\Option_0, \Option_1, \Agents \right>$ where each \mydef{agent} 
$\Agent\in\Agents$ purchases 
either some number of $\Option_0$ or $\Option_1$ options paying the price quoted by the 
market maker. We denote the total quantity purchased of $\Option_0$ and $\Option_1$
as $\QuantityYes$ and $\QuantityNo$ respectively. \\

A \mydef{market maker} $\MarketMaker$ provides liquidity in a market $\Market$ by
offering to trade either option $\Option$ at a price $\OptionPrice$ that it determines. 
Formally, a $\MarketMaker$ is a function 
that maps an option $\Option$, 
and a quantity $\Quantity\in\mathbb{R}_+$ at time $\Time \in [0,\EventTime)$ 
to a price $\OptionPrice(\Option,\Quantity,\Time) \in \mathbb{R}_+$. 
By definition, $\OptionPrice(\Option,\Quantity,\Time) = \Revealer(\Option_\Event)$ if 
$\Time \ge \EventTime$.\\

%%An \mydef{lmsr market maker} $\OptionPrice_\LMSRMarketMaker$ is a function
%that maps an option $\Option$, an agent $\Agent \in \Agents_\Option$, and
%a quantity $\Quantity\in\mathbb{R}_+$ at time $\Time \in [0,\Time_\Option)$ as a function of b $\LMSRb\in\mathbb{R}_+$.

\subsection{Assumptions}

In our model we assume without loss of generality that agent $\Agent \in \Agents$ has an arrival time 
$\Agent_\Time \in \mathbb{R}_+$ where $\Agent_\Time < \EventTime$, 
and execute their strategy only once at time $\Agent_\Time$.\\

We assume that agents' private beliefs and budgets are not common knowledge
but are drawn from known distributions $\AgentBelief \sim v(\cdot)$ and
$\AgentBudget \sim b(\cdot)$. For our experiments, we will assume that private beliefs are ${0,1}$ and that budgets are equal.\\

We assume agents are allowed to observe the true current price of any option $\forall \Time \in \left[0,\EventTime\right]$.\\

We assume that the market maker $\MarketMaker$ and all its parameters are common knowledge.\\
