%and reflects the likelihood 
%of $\Revealer(\Option_\Event) = \Option_\OptionDirection$ at the strike time $\Time_\Option$.
%A prediction market has a \mydef{book} $\Book$ that maps $\Agent\in\Agents_\Market$ 
%to a tuple $\left<\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}\right>$ which tracks the number of 
%$\Option_0$ and $\Option_1$ purchased by that \mydef{agent} $\Agent$.

%A \mydef{book} $\Book_{\Market,\Time}$ accepts an \mydef{agent} $\Agent$ and returns the number of 
%each \mydef{option} $\Option$ that \mydef{agent} $\Agent$ has purchased at time $\Time$. A 
%\mydef{book} $\Book$ at time $\Time$ records all the transactions made up to time $\Time$.\\

%A \mydef{market maker} $\MarketMaker$ is \mydef{prediction market} and strategy for setting prices
%on each \mydef{option} $\Option_0$ and $\Option_1$ at time $\Time$. Each \mydef{market maker} has
%their own function $\Price(\Option,\Time,\Agent,\mathbb{R})$ where the quantity $\mathbb{R}$ is the
%number of the option desired by the \mydef{agent} $\Agent$, and the output is the money $\Money$
%required by the \mydef{market maker} $\MarketMaker$ from the \mydef{agent} $\Agent$. \\
