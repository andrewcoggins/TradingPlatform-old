\section{Motivation}
The Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR), while popular in the theoretical
literature, faces several critical barriers to adoption. The first is that
the \mydef{market maker} is bounded loss, which is a non-starter for most
real world applications. The second is that the \mydef{market maker} is there is no definitive algorithm for setting the liquidity parameter $\LMSRb$. Since LMSR does not necessarily aggregate beliefs according to the rational expectations equilibrium with
one preset $\LMSRb$, we want to devise an algorithm for setting $\LMSRb$ such that we recover the rational expectations equilibrium aggregate belief. In addition, since $\LMSRb$ determines the market maker's loss, we want the selection of $\LMSRb$ values to be the least costly selection.

\section{Goal}
This work seeks to define an algorithm for determining the liquidity parameter in LMSR that minimizes cost while still recovering the aggregate belief according to the rational expectations equilibrium.
