\section{Model}

We denote \mydef{time} by $\Time\in\mathbb{R}_+$. \\

An \mydef{event} $\Event$ has an outcome at time $\Event_\EventTime \in \mathbb{R}_+$. 
We restrict our attention to binary outcomes. 
The outcome is equal to YES in case the event occurs, and NO otherwise. 
We denote the YES outcome with a 1, and the NO outcome with a 0.
We assume there is a way to unambiguously determine the outcome of an event. \\

$\Revealer$ is an \mydef{oracle} that maps an event to an outcome.
We denote the outcome of event $\Event$ under $\Revealer$ as 
$\Revealer(\Event) \in \{0,1\}$.\\

Given an event $\Event$, an \mydef{option} $\Option = \left<\Option_\Event, \Option_\OptionDirection\right>$ is a security that yields a return depending on 
the outcome of an event $\Option_\Event$. Each option has a direction 
$\Option_\OptionDirection \in \{0, 1\}$. 
The option will convert to \$1 at time $\Event_\EventTime$ if $\Revealer(\Option_\Event)$ equals 
$\Option_\OptionDirection$. Otherwise, it converts to \$0. Two options are said to be
\mydef{complementary} if they represent opposite directions on the same event.\\ 
%Given an
%event $\Event$, we denote the complementary options as 
%$\Option_\Event = \left<\Option_{0}, \Option_{1}\right>$.

%Given complementary options $\Option_{0}$ and $\Option_{1}$,
%let $\Agents_{\Option_0}$ be the \mydef{set of agents} that acquire option
%$\Option_{0}$, and similarly let $\Agents_{\Option_1}$ be the set 
%of agents that acquire option $\Option_{1}$. 
%Let $\Agents_\Option = \Agents_{\Option_0} \cup \Agents_{\Option_1}$
%be the set of all agents trading complementary options.\\

Given an option $\Option$, an \mydef{agent} $\Agent\in\Agents$ has a \mydef{private belief} 
$\Agent_\AgentBelief \in [0,1]$ about event $\Event$, and a \mydef{budget} $\Agent_\AgentBudget \in \mathbb{R}_+$.
The agent's private belief $\Agent_\AgentBelief$ 
is the subjective probability that the agent
<<<<<<< HEAD
assigns to the outcome of event $\Option_\Event$ being direction $\Option_\OptionDirection$
at strike time $\Option_\Time$.\\

%A \mydef{prediction market} $\Market$ trades complementary options. 
Formally, a prediction market is a tuple $\Market = 
\left<\Option_c, \Agents_\Option \right>$ where each \mydef{agent} 
$\Agent\in\Agents_\Option$ purchases or sells

assigns to the outcome $\Option_\Event$ being direction $\Option_\OptionDirection$
at strike time $\Event_\EventTime$. \\

A \mydef{prediction market} $\Market$ is a forum for trading complementary options. 
Formally, a prediction market is a tuple $\Market = 
\left<\Option_0, \Option_1, \Agents, \QuantityYes, \QuantityNo\right>$ where each \mydef{agent} 
$\Agent\in\Agents$ purchases 
>>>>>>> newInterfaces
either some number of $\Option_0$ or $\Option_1$ options paying the price quoted by the 
market maker $\MarketMaker$. We denote the total quantity purchased of $\Option_0$ and $\Option_1$
as $\QuantityYes$ and $\QuantityNo$ respectively. These quantities are typically initialized to zero. \\

A \mydef{market maker} $\MarketMaker$ provides liquidity in a market $\Market$ by
offering to trade either $\Option_0$ or $\Option_1$ at a price $\OptionPrice$ that it determines. 
Formally, $\MarketMaker$ is a function 
that maps an option $\Option$, 
and a quantity $\Quantity\in\mathbb{R}_+$ at time $\Time \in [0,\EventTime)$ 
to a price $\OptionPrice_{\Time}(\Option,\Quantity) \in \mathbb{R}_+$. 
By definition, $\OptionPrice_{\Time}(\Option,\Quantity) = \Revealer(\Option_\Event)$, if 
$\Time \ge \EventTime$. \\

The \mydef{equilibrium price} $P$ is the aggregate belief according to the Rational Expectations Equilibrium, which is defined below. $P$ is the market price that takes all of the agents' private beliefs $\Agent_\AgentBelief$ into account. The goal of the market maker $\MarketMaker$ is to recover $P$ such that $\OptionPrice_{\Time}(\Option,\Quantity) = P$, if $\Time > \max_{\Agent \in \Agents} \Agent_\Time$. \\

%%An \mydef{lmsr market maker} $\OptionPrice_\LMSRMarketMaker$ is a function
%that maps an option $\Option$, an agent $\Agent \in \Agents_\Option$, and
%a quantity $\Quantity\in\mathbb{R}_+$ at time $\Time \in [0,\Time_\Option)$ as a function of b $\LMSRb\in\mathbb{R}_+$.

\subsection{Assumptions}

In our model we assume without loss of generality that agent $\Agent \in \Agents$ has an arrival time 
$\Agent_\Time \in \mathbb{R}_+$ where $\Agent_\Time < \EventTime$, 
and execute its strategy only once at time $\Agent_\Time$. We will refer to the price after all agents have participated - $\OptionPrice_{\Time}(\Option,\Quantity)$ where $\Time > \max_{\Agent \in \Agents} \Agent_\Time$ - as the final market price.\\

%We assume that agents' private beliefs and budgets are drawn from distributions, which are known, $\AgentBelief \sim F(\cdot)$ and
%$\AgentBudget \sim F(\cdot)$.\\
We assume that all agents have a budget equal to 1.\\

<<<<<<< HEAD
We assume that agents' private beliefs and budgets are not common knowledge
but are drawn from known distributions $\AgentBelief \sim v(\cdot)$ and
$\AgentBudget \sim b(\cdot)$.\\
=======
We assume agents observe the current price of both options $\Option_0$ and $\Option_1$.\\
