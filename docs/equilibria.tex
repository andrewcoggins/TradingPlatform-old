\section{Rational Expectations Equilibrium}
In order to constrain our algorithm for setting the liquidity parameter $\LMSRb$ such that the final market price is equal to the aggregate belief, we first must define the aggregate belief. We will use a standard solution concept from the literature.\\

The \mydef{Rational Expectations Equilibrium} (REE) hypothesizes that all agents act as if they knew the private belief $\Agent_\AgentBelief$ of all other agents \cite{10.2307/1911360}. This fully revealing hypothesis implies that all agents would operate as if their belief were the aggregate belief constructed from the pooled information. As a result, the equilibrium price should be the aggregate belief regardless of the market mechanism.\\

Since REE is a perfectly competitive equilibrium concept, the aggregate belief is the budget weighted average of each of the agents private beliefs. Formally, $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{|\Agents|} (\Agent^{i}_{\AgentBelief} \Agent^{i}_{\AgentBudget})}{\sum_{j=1}^{|\Agents|} \Agent^{j}_{\AgentBudget}}$. When agents have equal budgets, the REE reduces to: $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{|\Agents|} \Agent^{i}_{\AgentBelief}}{|\Agents|}$.\\
