\section{Model}

\subsection{Definitions}

We denote \mydef{time} by $\Time\in\mathbb{R}_+$. \\

An \mydef{event} $\Event$ has an outcome at time $\Event_\Time \in \mathbb{R}_+$ 
where we restrict our attention to a binary outcome. 
The outcome is equal to YES in case the event occurs, and NO otherwise. 
We denote the YES outcome with a 1, and the NO outcome with a 0.
We assume there is a way to unambiguously determine the outcome of an event. \\

$\Revealer$ is an \mydef{oracle} for mapping an event to an outcome.
We denote the outcome of event $\Event$ under $\Revealer$ as 
$\Revealer(\Event) \in \{0,1\}$.\\

An \mydef{option} $\Option$ is a security that yields a return depending on 
the outcome of an event $\Option_\Event$ at time $\Event_\Time$. Each option has a direction 
$\Option_\OptionDirection \in \{0, 1\}$ and a strike time $\Option_\Time = \Event_\Time$ 
when $\Revealer(\Option_\Event)$ will be evaluated. 
The option will convert to \$1 at time $\Option_\Time$ if $\Revealer(\Option_\Event)$ equals 
$\Option_\OptionDirection$, otherwise it converts to \$0. Two options are said to be
\mydef{complementary options} if they trade opposite directions in the same event. Given an
event $\Event$, we denote the complementary options as 
$\OptionComplements = \left<\Option_{0}, \Option_{1}\right>$.\\

Given complementary options $\Option_{0}$ and $\Option_{1}$,
let $\Agents_{\Option_0}$ be the \mydef{set of agents} that acquire option
$\Option_{0}$, and similarly let $\Agents_{\Option_1}$ be the set 
of agents that acquire option $\Option_{1}$. 
Let $\Agents_\Option = \Agents_{\Option_0} \cup \Agents_{\Option_1}$
be the set of all agents trading complementary options.\\

An \mydef{agent} $\Agent\in\Agents_\Option$ has a \mydef{private belief} 
$\Agent_\AgentBelief \in {0,1}$ 
and a \mydef{budget} $\Agent_\AgentBudget \in \mathbb{R}_+$.
The agent's private belief $\Agent_\AgentBelief$ 
is the subjective probability that the agent
assigns to the outcome of event $\Option_\Event$ being direction $\Option_\OptionDirection$
at strike time $\Option_\Time$.\\

An agent's $\Agent\in\Agents_\Option$ \mydef{strategy} 
$\AgentStrategy_\Agent(\Time) \in \mathbb{R}_+$ specifies the quantity of option 
$\Option$ purchased by the agent at time $\Time$.\\

A \mydef{prediction market} $\Market$ trades complementary options. 
Formally, a prediction market is a tuple $\Market = 
\left<\Option_c, \Agents_\Option \right>$ where each \mydef{agent} 
$\Agent\in\Agents_\Option$ purchases 
either some number of $\Option_0$ or $\Option_1$ options paying the price quoted by the 
market maker.\\

A \mydef{market maker} $\OptionPrice_\MarketMaker$ is a function 
that maps an option $\Option$, an agent $\Agent \in \Agents_\Option$, 
and a quantity $\Quantity\in\mathbb{R}_+$ at time $\Time \in [0,\Time_\Option)$ 
to a price $\OptionPrice(\Option,\Agent,\Quantity,\Time) \in \mathbb{R}_+$. 
By definition $\OptionPrice(\Option,\Agent, \Time) = \Revealer(\Option_\Event)$ if 
$\Time \ge \Time_\Option$.

An \mydef{lmsr market maker} $\OptionPrice_\LMSRMarketMaker$ is a function
that maps an option $\Option$, an agent $\Agent \in \Agents_\Option$, and
a quantity $\Quantity\in\mathbb{R}_+$ at time $\Time \in [0,\Time_\Option)$ as a function of b $\LMSRb\in\mathbb{R}_+$.

\subsection{Assumptions}

In our model we assume without loss of generality that agent $\Agent \in \Agents_\Option$ has an arrival time 
$\Agent_\Time \in \mathbb{R}_+$ where $\Agent_\Time < \Option_\Time$, 
and execute their strategy only once at time $\Agent_\Time$.\\

We assume that agents' private beliefs and budgets are not common knowledge
but are drawn from known distributions $\AgentBelief \sim v(\cdot)$ and
$\AgentBudget \sim b(\cdot)$. For our experiments, we will assume that private beliefs are ${0,1}$ and that budgets are equal.\\

We assume agents are allowed to observe the true current price of any option.\\

We assume that the market maker mechanism and all its parameters are common knowledge.\\
