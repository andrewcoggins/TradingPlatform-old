\section{Motivation}
The Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR), while popular in the theoretical
literature, faces several critical barriers to adoption. The first is that
the \mydef{market maker} is bounded loss, which is a non-starter for most
real world applications. The second is that the \mydef{market maker} is not
sensitive to liquidity. This means that a improperly configured \mydef{market maker}
might allow any agent with a positive budget to drastically swing the price or at
the other extreme, not allow any agent to modify the price much at all. LMSR is
well studied, however, because it has Path Independence and Translation Invariance.
Many other theoretical \mydef{market makers} have been proposed that also have
these two properties, but with additional benefits, and some offer tradeoffs in
order to gain more desirable properties. This work seeks to quantify these
tradeoffs empirically.

\section{Goals}
To test five different market maker mechanisms for their liquidity sensitivity,
profit expectation, and accuracy.
